# Depth First Graph

## Summary
This is a method that extends the existing graph class. It is used to return all of the vertice in a graph using a depth first process

## Challenge
See above

## Methods

### `depthFirst(arity 1)`
* Used to list all of the vertice in a graph.
* Receives a starting vertex
* Returns a set of vertice that are included in the graph

## Testing
* Tests passed with 100% coverage:**
* Tested that a starting vertex was passed in and returns conversational error message if not.
* Tested that there were vertex in the graph.
* Tested that the vertice in the graph were all returned
