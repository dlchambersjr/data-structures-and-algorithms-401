# Lab-05 Linked lists (SINGLY LINKED LIST)

## Summary
Problem Domain:  A solution is needed that will create a class called ```Linkedlist```.  This class will accept nodes and maintain a ```head``` property to point to the first node in the list.  Three methods will be attached to ```Linkedlist```, (```insert```, ```includes```, and ```print```), to manipulate the list.  There will also be a ```Node``` class that will create instances of ```Node``` to be added to the linked list.

## Challenge


## Methods

### insert(arity 1)
* Used to insert a node into the first position of the list.
* It will receive a value to be used when the node is created.
* It will move the HEAD pointer to redirect to the new node.

### includes(arity 1)
* Used to find a particular value in the list.
* It will receive a value to be searched for.
* it will a boolean reponse for if the value exists or not.

### print(arity 0)
* Used to display the values of all nodes in the list.
* Does not reveive any values

## Testing
The following tests should be performed:
### Verify the classes work
* Can I create an empty Linkedlist
* Can I create an new Node

### Insert
* insert-1: Are there any nodes.
* insert-2:
