# Lab-26 Hash Tables

## Summary
Problem Domain:  Create a hash map data structure that includes methods to `add()`, `find()`, `contains()`, `getHash()` key/value pairs to the hash map.

## Challenge


## Methods

### hash(arity 1)
* Used to create an index position
* Receives a key to hash
* Returns a hashed value to use as an index position.

### add(arity 2)
* Used to add key/value pair into the hash map.
* It will receive a key and value to be added.

### Find(arity 1)
* Used to find a particular value in hash table.
* It will receive a key to be searched for.
* it will return the value from the key value pair.

### contains(arity 1)
* Used to check if the key is contained in the hash table.
* Receives a key to check.
* Returns a boolean result.

### getHash(arity 1)
* Used to get the index value of a particular key.
* Receives a key to check.
* Returns the hashed index position.

## Testing
Tests passed with 100% coverage:
* Tested the creation of a new hash map class.
* Tested that all methods caught errors and returned conversational results.
* Tested that all methods received proper input.
* Tested ability to add a value to a hash table.
* Tested ability to find a key and return the value.
* Tested ability to see if a key was contained in the hash table.
* Tested ability to return the hashed index of a key.
