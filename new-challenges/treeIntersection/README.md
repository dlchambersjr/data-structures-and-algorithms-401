# Tree Intersection
## Summary
Problem Domain:  Create a function that receives two binary trees and returns an array of values that are included in both trees.

## Challenge
Uses the hash map class and the binary tree class

## functions

### treeIntersection(arity 2)
* Receives two binary trees
* Returns the the values that are included in both trees


## Testing
Tests for function treeIntersection(arity 2) passed 100%:
* Test to verify the instantiations of the binary tree class and nodes.
* Tested that each tree had values.
* Tested that trees were passed.
* Tested for no intersecting values
* Tested to find duplicate in a mixed case string.
* Tested for no duplicates.
